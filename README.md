 This is a practice project taken from an image composed of an index, two directories, one for styles and one for scripts. The index has a small demo of basic responsive and CSS animations. In the javascript section I created a function to determine the position of the scroll and thus assign a new class to the header and the last script I created to create the menu animation.
